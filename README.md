## How to configure a Raspberry Pi 4 as a home network router and a Wi-Fi access point

Here is a how-to guide for setting up a Raspberry Pi as a home network router and a wireless Wi-Fi access point.

The Raspberry Pi uses the following configuration
- Built-in ethernet connector for connecting to the Internet
- A USB ethernet adapter for connection to the local area network
- Built-in Wi-Fi for creating the wireless access point.

## Hardware requirements

Required:
- Raspberry Pi (version 4 model B used here)
- USB 3.0 Gigabit Ethernet adapter (TP-LINK UE300 used here)
- microSD card used as the boot disk (minimum capacity 8 GB)
- Power source

Useful when setting up or troubleshooting:
- Monitor
- Micro HDMI cable
- USB keyboard

## Setting up the system


### Initialize Boot disk 

1. Download `Raspberry Pi OS Lite` from the [Raspberry Pi website](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/).

1. Install the image `raspbian_lite_latest.zip` on a microSD memory card with [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/).


### Connect peripherals

1. Plug in the memory card to the microSD card slot. It is located on the bottom side of the Raspberry Pi at the end opposite to the USB connectors.

1. Plug in the Ethernet adapter to a blue USB 3.0 connector,

1. Plug in a monitor with a micro HDMI cable to either micro HDMI port.

1. Plug in a USB keyboard to any available USB port.

1. Plug in a power source to the USB-C connector.  


### Configure Raspberry Pi Software Configuration

Start the Raspberry Pi Software Configuration Tool `raspi-config`:
```
$ sudo raspi-config
```

Select the following options:

5\. Localisation Options
  - L3 Keyboard
    - **select the proper keyboard layout**
  - L2 Timezone
    - **select the proper timezone**
  - L4 WLAN Country
    - **select the proper WLAN country**

1\. System Options
  - S3 Password
    - **select a new password** for the `pi` user
  - S4 Hostname
    - **select a new hostname** for the computer

3\. Interface Options
  - P2 SSH
    - **enable** remote command line access using SSH

6\. Advanced Options
  - A1 Expand Filesystem
    ** select this** to use all available storage space on your boot media
  - A4 Network Interface Names
    - **enable** predictable network interface names
    - this will make a USB ethernet adapter with MAC address `d0:37:45:a7:7f:a3` appear as interface Â´enxd03745a77fa3`

Reboot the Raspberry Pi after changing all the settings.


### Upgrade and install packages

Upgrade packages to latest versions.

```
$ sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade 

```

Install required packages:

```
$ sudo apt install dnsmasq netfilter-persistent iptables-persistent hostapd  
```

`dnsmasq` runs a DNS and DHCP server on the local area network.

`netfilter-persistent` and `iptables-persistent` are used to save and restore firewall rules.

`hostapd` makes the Pi act as a Wi-Fi access point

Also optionally install the following packages:

```
$ sudo apt install screen dnsutils
```

`screen` is useful for running a terminal session.

`dnsutils` contains the command `dig` that is useful for checking that domain name service queries work both for local and Internet addresses.   


### Enable IP forwarding 

Uncomment the following line on `/etc/sysctl.conf` or add file `/etc/sysctl.d/ip-routing.conf` with the following 
content to enable IP forwarding:

```
net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
```

Apply the new setting without rebooting: 

```
$ sudo sysctl --system
```


### Enable masquerading

Add a postrouting rule to table `nat` of iptables to masquerade traffic from other interfaces as coming from `eth0`: 

```
$ sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
$ sudo netfilter-persistent save
```

Note: if the `iptables` command above gives an error message, you may need to reboot your Raspberry Pi. 

You can check the masquerading rule and its statistics with this command: 

```
$ sudo iptables -t nat -vL POSTROUTING
Chain POSTROUTING (policy ACCEPT 4984 packets, 331K bytes)
 pkts bytes target     prot opt in     out     source               destination         
 5169  441K MASQUERADE  all  --  any    eth0    anywhere             anywhere
```


### Configure local area network 

Find out name of the external ethernet adapter. This command lists all network interfaces:

```
$ ip a
...
3: enxd03745a77fa3: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state DOWN group default qlen 1000
...
```

The name should have prefix `enx`. In the example above the interface name is `enxd03745a77fa3`

Append DHCP client configuration to file `/etc/dhcpcd.conf`:

```
interface eth0
  static domain_name=home

# TODO use name of your interface
interface enxd03745a77fa3
  static ip_address=10.10.0.1/24

interface wlan0
  static ip_address=10.20.0.1/24
  nohook wpa_supplicant
```

Append DNS and DHCP server configuration to file `/etc/dnsmasq.conf`:

```
# run DNS and DHCP server on these interfaces
interface=enxd03745a77fa3  # TODO use name of your interface
interface=wlan0

# use local domain .home
domain=home
expand-hosts

# assign fixed IP and hostname to certain devices based on MAC address
dhcp-host=ac:dc:de:ad:be:ef,10.10.0.2,mylaptop,24h

# give IP addresses from this range to devices at ethernet interface
dhcp-range=10.10.0.100,10.10.0.250,24h

# give IP addresses from this range to devices at Wi-Fi acces point
dhcp-range=10.20.0.100,10.20.0.250,24h

# name of this device
address=/pi.home/10.10.0.1
```

### Configure Wi-Fi access point

Unblock Wi-Fi radio with the following command:
```
$ sudo rfkill unblock wlan
```

Run this command to see which Wi-Fi channels are available for 2 GHz and 5 GHz modes:

```
$ iwlist wlan0 channel
```

Add configuration to file `/etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf`:

```
ssid=MyPiNetwork
country_code=FI
interface=wlan0

# 5GHz mode
hw_mode=a
channel=36
ieee80211n=1
ieee80211ac=1
macaddr_acl=0

# WPA authentication
wpa_passphrase=TODO-Wi-Fi-network-password
auth_algs=1
ignore_broadcast_ssid=0
wpa=2
wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
wpa_pairwise=TKIP
rsn_pairwise=CCMP
```

Choose the values you want to use: 
- `ssid`: Wi-Fi network name
- `country_code`: [two-letter ISO 3166-1 country code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1) 
- `hw_mode`: protocol version:
  - `a` = IEEE 802.11a (5 Ghz), 
  - `b` = IEEE 802.11b (2.4 Ghz)
  - `g` = IEEE 802.11g (2.4 GHz)
- `channel`
  - available channels depend on `hw_mode`
- `wpa_passphrase`: Wi-Fi password


## Getting it running

When all configuration is done, do the following:
 
1. Power off Raspberry Pi
1. Plug in Internet ethernet cable to internal ethernet port
1. Plug in local area network (LAN) ethernet cable to external ethernet adapter 
1. Power on Raspberry Pi

Devices connected to LAN should get local IP addresses in the range `10.10.0.1/24` from the DHCP server on the Raspberry Pi.
Devices connected to the Wi-Fi Access Point should get IP addresses in the range `10.20.0.1/24`.
All devices should be able to connect to the Internet.


## Troubleshooting and resources

Here are some useful commands for troubleshooting:

| command | explanation |

| `lsusb -v` | show information on USB devices |
| `ip a` | show addresses assigned to all network interface |
| `iw dev wlan0 info` | show information on wireless device `wlan0` |
| `tail -f /var/log/syslog` | show system log |
| `systemctl status hostapd` | show status of service `hostapd` |
| `journalctl -xe` | show log output of services started by `systemd` |
| `sudo iwlist wlan0 scan` | show list of access points and ad-hoc cells seen by wireless interface `wlan0` |

| `sudo iftop` | display bandwidth usage by host |

### Install driver for TP-link AC600 Wi-Fi adapter 

If you want to use the external `TP-link AC600` Wi-Fi adapter, you need to download a driver from [http://downloads.fars-robotics.net/](http://downloads.fars-robotics.net/). The site contains instructions for installing the driver.

Get the correct driver for your kernel version. Here is, for example, the driver for kernel version  `5.10.11-v7l-1399`:

http://downloads.fars-robotics.net/wifi-drivers/8812au-drivers/8812au-5.10.11-v7l-1399.tar.gz
 
 
### Fix TP-LINK UE300 Mode

The particular USB 3.0 Ethernet adapter I used boots in USB Mass Media mode and needs to be reset before it works as an ethernet adapter. 

Reset the adapter by adding the following `udev` rule to file  `/etc/udev/rules.d/80-r8152.rules`:
```
ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ENV{ID_VENDOR_ID}=="2357", ENV{ID_MODEL_ID}=="0600", RUN+="/usr/sbin/usb_modeswitch -v 2357 -p 0600 -R"
```
